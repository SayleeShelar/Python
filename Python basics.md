# Python Basics Tutorial

## Introduction

Python is a case-sensitive programming language. It offers several data types, including `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and `complex`.

### Variables

Unlike other languages, Python does not require you to define the data type of a variable. For example:

```python
a = 2
```

Note that strings are stored in double quotes.

### Input and Concatenation

Python uses the `input()` function to take input from the user. Concatenation can be done using the `+` operator.

### String Manipulation

Python provides several string manipulation methods, such as `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.find()`, and the `in` operator.

### Arithmetic Operators

Python supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Operator precedence is also observed.

### Comments

Comments in Python can be single-line (`#`) or multi-line (`''' ... '''`). They are used for documentation and code clarity.

### Comparison and Logical Operators

Python supports comparison (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) and logical (`or`, `and`, `not`) operators.

### Control Flow

Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for control flow. Indentation is used to define the block of code.

### Loops

Python supports `while` and `for` loops. `while` is used for indefinite iteration, while `for` is used for definite iteration.

### Data Structures

Python offers several built-in data structures, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

- **Lists**: Mutable, can store different types of data, and support indexing and slicing.
- **Tuples**: Immutable, only allows unique values, and supports count and index operations.
- **Sets**: Unordered and contains only unique elements.
- **Dictionaries**: Contains key-value pairs.

### Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. They can have default arguments and can return values.
